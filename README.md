'Using web sockets to make communication between client and server'


### ***A detailed report of the task*** :
 1. In this project we have created a server and number of clients in which two-way interactive communication between         client and the server is enabled
 2. The connection between server and client is enabled by using ***websockets*** and ***async*** libraries.
 3. Once the server and client are connected the server using ***Fraker*** library starts generating random datas like         name, address etc. and it will send all the data to the client.
 4. The client would receive the messeges sended by the server and it will select the type of data it wants and timestamps     only the selected type of messages.
 5. Then the client will receive a block of data (block sizes for different clients are different) and caculate the time       taken to receive that block of data and then it would Log that block into a text file using ***logging*** module of       python.
 6. Then the client would send a response back to the server "client <client_name> received <n> block in <t> timeâ€™, where     n has to be the sequence number of the block that the client received and time t taken for the client to receive the       entire message block.
 7. The server would print any of the message received by the client

 Steps taken in finishing the task :
 
   Both of us collaborated via this github repository for sharing and working on the code. Sometimes we sat together and made algorithms such as that when we had to   log   data in blocks and not log individual messages and whenever we encountered a bug, we would think over how to resolve it. For all references and help, google remained   our saviour as it guided us to various documentations for various modules and showed us how we can apply and use them as per our requirrements. Finally, we compiled   all our code, produced the required output, and henceforth commited all changes to this repository.
 
 
 A brief description of the modules used and why they were chosen :
 
   In our code for server and client, we have used the asyncio, websockets, logging, time, datetime and faker modules. While Asyncio and websocket modules were crucial to be able to establish connection and successfully run the connection between server and client, the other modules were applicable to serve various purposes. The logging module allowed us to store the required data and consequenctly log that data in different block size of each client into it's respective data file. The  time module allowed for creating timestamps for blocks and for each individual message and through timestamps we were able to calculate the time taken by the client to receive each block.
    
The datetime module was just used to get the current date and time at which each message was received by the client from the server.
    
    
   The faker module was used for generating various random data such as name, country, city etc. which was sent from server to client and which was also logged in blocks in the respective client's data file.
